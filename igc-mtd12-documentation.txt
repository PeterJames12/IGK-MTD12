The essence of the project is ability to make reservations for Java projects that igc-mtd12 team will perform.

Java developer team.

The structure of java developer team:
pages: index.jsp - is the main page for customers, ther–µ is special form where anyone can send his order, then admin immediately sees it and gives answer. Also this page a bit describes our team. Link Sing In redirect you in login.jsp

login.jsp: it is spring security that checks your login ang pass, "admin" "1234" (you won't see "1234" because I use crypto)
After logging you'll see new links Admin and Developer. If you are not logging and type /admin you'll see login form.

admin.jsp: makes possible to create a project, see all project and add new developers.
All information takes from database PostgreSQL.

developer.jsp: you type your name and password which storage in database and if it is correct and you have project you will see that.
Also if you have some questions to admin, there is special form for that.

I worked with following technologies: Spring Framework(Security), Java Mail, PostgreSQL, Maven, Lombok, Tomcat, Intellij IDEA, HTML & CSS, JavaScript.
Also i worked with JSF, Hibernate, Ajax, but Tomcat doesn't work with JSF so i don't use that in a project.
